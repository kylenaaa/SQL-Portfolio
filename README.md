This repository contains my Data Analytics portfolio project/s in MySQL.

COFFEE PARK is a new restaurant that will open up in New Jersey, USA. It offers dine in, take out, and delivery.
The objective is to design and build a relational database that will capture and store all important information and data that the business generates.

A BI tool is also used to allow the owner to monitor business performance in dashboards.
