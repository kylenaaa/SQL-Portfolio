This repository contains my Data Analytics portfolio project/s in MySQL.

COFFEE PARK is a new restaurant that will open up in New Jersey, USA. It offers dine in, take out, and delivery.
The objective is to design and build a relational database that will capture and store all important information and data that the business generates.

QuickDBD was used to create the relatinal databases.
Tableau was used to allow the owner to monitor business performance in dashboards.
